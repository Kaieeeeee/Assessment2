# Assessment 2 - Smart Contract with hardhat and node.js

## Description
For this project, create a simple contract with 2-3 functions. Then show the values of those functions in frontend of the application. You can use this starter template to get a head start.

You will again upload your code to Github and share a video walk-through as explained below.

You can run the code locally, or you can use GitPod here:

Upload your solution to GitHub and share the link with us along with a quick code walk-through as explained below.

### Functions
- **getTransaction**: how many transaction in a specific process

- **getTotalTransaction**: total transaction of both process
- **registerTransaction**
- **transact**

#### Getting Started
1. To execute this you will need to install VS code or Gitpod to run this.

2. You will also need to install node.js and to get an metamask extension on your browser

Other notes: 
After cloning the github, you will want to do the following to get the code running on your computer.

1. Inside the project directory, in the terminal type: npm i
   
2. Open two additional terminals in your VS code
   
3. In the second terminal type: npx hardhat node
   
4. In the third terminal, type: npx hardhat run --network localhost scripts/deploy.js
   
5. Back in the first terminal, type npm run dev to launch the front-end.

After this, the project will be running on your localhost. 
Typically at http://localhost:3000/
